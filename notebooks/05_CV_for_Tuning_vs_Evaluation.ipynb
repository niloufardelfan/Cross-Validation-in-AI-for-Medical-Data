    "# # Notebook 5: CV for Hyperparameter Tuning vs. Model Evaluation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## Goals\n",
    "# * Distinguish between the two primary uses of cross-validation:\n",
    "#     1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Selecting the best model settings.\n",
    "#     2.  **Model Evaluation:** Estimating the performance of the final chosen model.\n",
    "# * Implement hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`, which uses CV internally.\n",
    "# * Understand why the score reported by `GridSearchCV` (`best_score_`) is **optimistically biased** and should **not** be reported as the final model performance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 1. Two Distinct Goals for Cross-Validation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Cross-validation is a powerful tool, but it's vital to recognize its different applications:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Use Case 1: Hyperparameter Tuning (Model Selection)**\n",
    "# *   **Purpose:** To find the optimal settings (hyperparameters) for a model or to choose between different model types. Examples of hyperparameters include the `C` parameter in Logistic Regression/SVM, the number of trees in a Random Forest, or the learning rate in neural networks.\n",
    "# *   **Method:** Tools like `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` automate this. They systematically try different combinations of hyperparameters. For *each combination*, they perform an internal cross-validation on the training data to estimate how well that specific combination performs. The combination yielding the best average CV score is selected as the \"best\".\n",
    "# *   **Output:** The optimal set of hyperparameters (`best_params_`).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Use Case 2: Model Evaluation (Performance Estimation)**\n",
    "# *   **Purpose:** To estimate the generalization performance (e.g., accuracy, AUC) of a *single, finalized* model (often one with hyperparameters already chosen via tuning) on unseen data.\n",
    "# *   **Method:** Apply a CV strategy (like `StratifiedKFold` or `GroupKFold`) to the model using functions like `cross_val_score` or `cross_validate`.\n",
    "# *   **Output:** A performance estimate, usually reported as mean +/- standard deviation across the folds (e.g., `0.85 +/- 0.03` AUC).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## 2. The Pitfall: Reporting Tuning Scores as Final Performance\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A common mistake is to use `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters and then report its `.best_score_` attribute as the final estimate of how well the model will perform on new data.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why is this wrong?**\n",
    "# The `.best_score_` from `GridSearchCV` is the score achieved on the *internal* validation folds *used during the search*. The hyperparameters were *chosen specifically because* they maximized performance on these folds. The process has selected the parameters that best fit the idiosyncrasies of those particular data splits.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Therefore, `.best_score_` reflects the performance of the *tuning process itself* on that dataset, not necessarily how a model trained with those chosen parameters will perform on *completely new, unseen data* that wasn't involved in the tuning process at all. It's an **optimistically biased** estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 3. Setup and Data\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We'll use our development data and a model that has hyperparameters to tune (Logistic Regression with `C`). We also need a pipeline for proper preprocessing.\n",

    "# *   The score reported directly from this tuning process (`.best_score_`) is **optimistically biased** because the parameters were chosen to maximize performance on those specific internal splits.\n",
    "# *   Reporting this tuning score as the final model performance is misleading.\n",
    "# *   A better approach is to evaluate the *single best model* found by tuning using a *separate* CV loop, but the gold standard for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the entire modeling *process* (including tuning) is **Nested Cross-Validation**, which we will explore next."
