    "# # Notebook 6: Nested Cross-Validation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## Goals\n",
    "# * Understand the concept and rationale behind Nested Cross-Validation.\n",
    "# * Implement Nested CV to get a more unbiased estimate of model performance *after* hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "# * Compare the Nested CV score with the biased score from simple `GridSearchCV`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 1. The Need for Nested Cross-Validation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As discussed in Notebook 5, using the same cross-validation process for both hyperparameter tuning and final model evaluation leads to an optimistically biased performance estimate. Why? Because the hyperparameters are chosen specifically to perform well on the validation folds used during tuning.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Nested Cross-Validation** provides a solution by separating the CV processes for tuning and evaluation into two loops:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1.  **Outer Loop (Evaluation Loop):**\n",
    "#     *   Splits the data into K folds (e.g., using `StratifiedKFold` or `GroupKFold` appropriate for the final evaluation goal).\n",
    "#     *   Its primary purpose is **evaluation**. The final performance estimate comes from averaging scores across the validation sets of this outer loop.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2.  **Inner Loop (Tuning Loop):**\n",
    "#     *   Runs *independently* within **each training split** of the outer loop.\n",
    "#     *   Takes the training data from the current outer fold and performs *another* CV (e.g., using `GridSearchCV` with its own K' splits) **solely on that subset** to find the best hyperparameters *for that specific outer fold*.\n",
    "#     *   Its primary purpose is **hyperparameter tuning** for the model being trained in the current outer fold.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **How it works (per Outer Fold):**\n",
    "# 1.  Outer loop splits data into `Outer Train` and `Outer Validation`.\n",
    "# 2.  An **Inner CV** (e.g., `GridSearchCV`) is run *only* on the `Outer Train` data to find the locally best hyperparameters (`best_params_inner`).\n",
    "# 3.  A *new model* is trained on the *entire* `Outer Train` data using `best_params_inner`.\n",
    "# 4.  This model is then evaluated on the held-out `Outer Validation` set. This score is recorded.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The final Nested CV performance estimate is the average of the scores recorded in step 4 across all folds of the Outer Loop.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Benefit:** The evaluation in the outer loop uses data that was **never seen** during the hyperparameter tuning process (the inner loop for that fold), yielding a much less biased estimate of the true generalization performance of the *entire model selection pipeline* (including tuning).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Drawback:** Increased computational cost (K_outer * K_inner model trainings, roughly).\n",

    "# 4.  Perform one **final evaluation** on the **hold-out Test Set** (`X_test`, `y_test`) that was set aside in Notebook 0. This provides the ultimate check on performance before considering deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Nested Cross-Validation is the gold standard when you need to both tune hyperparameters and obtain an unbiased estimate of the final model pipeline's generalization performance. By nesting the tuning process within an outer evaluation loop, it prevents the optimistic bias inherent in using the same data splits for both selection and evaluation. While computationally more intensive, the reliability gained, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine, often justifies the cost."
