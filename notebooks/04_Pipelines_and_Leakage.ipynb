    "# # Notebook 4: Preventing Data Leakage with Pipelines\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## Goals\n",
    "# * Understand how preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, imputation) can cause **Data Leakage** if applied incorrectly during cross-validation.\n",
    "# * Demonstrate the wrong way (applying preprocessing *before* CV) and the right way (using `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`).\n",
    "# * Emphasize why Pipelines are essential for valid model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 1. The Problem: Data Leakage from Preprocessing\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Many machine learning algorithms perform better when input features are preprocessed. Common steps include:\n",
    "# *   **Scaling/Normalization:** Bringing features to a similar range (e.g., using `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`).\n",
    "# *   **Imputation:** Filling in missing values (e.g., using `SimpleImputer`).\n",
    "# *   **Feature Selection:** Choosing a subset of relevant features (e.g., based on statistical tests).\n",
    "# *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features (e.g., using `PCA`).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **The Danger:** These preprocessing steps often learn parameters *from the data itself*.\n",
    "# *   `StandardScaler` learns the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "# *   `SimpleImputer` learns the mean, median, or most frequent value.\n",
    "# *   Feature selection methods might calculate correlations or p-values across the data.\n",
    "# *   `PCA` finds principal components based on the data's variance structure.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Leakage Scenario:** If you apply a preprocessor (like `StandardScaler`) to your *entire* development dataset *before* performing cross-validation:\n",
    "# 1.  The scaler calculates the mean/std using **all** the data (including samples that will later be in the validation folds).\n",
    "# 2.  You then split the *already scaled* data into train/validation folds during CV.\n",
    "# 3.  The model is trained on a fold's training set and evaluated on its validation set.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Why is this wrong?** The scaling applied to the validation set was influenced by the validation set samples themselves (via the initial `fit` on the whole dataset). The model effectively gets a \"peek\" at information from the validation set through the shared scaling parameters. This violates the principle of evaluating the model on data it has truly never seen (or been influenced by) before.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Result:** Artificially inflated performance scores during CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 2. The Solution: Scikit-learn Pipelines\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A `Pipeline` object chains multiple processing steps (transformers) and a final estimator (model) together. When a `Pipeline` is used within a cross-validation function (`cross_val_score`, `cross_validate`, `GridSearchCV`):\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1.  For each CV fold:\n",
    "#     *   The preprocessing steps (`fit` and `transform` methods) are applied **only** to the **training portion** of that fold.\n",
    "#     *   The *fitted* preprocessors are then used to `transform` the **validation portion** of that fold.\n",
    "#     *   The final estimator is trained on the preprocessed training data and evaluated on the preprocessed validation data.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This correctly simulates the real-world scenario where preprocessing is learned *only* from the training data and then applied to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 3. Setup and Data Preparation\n",

    "# Data leakage from preprocessing steps applied before cross-validation is a common and serious error that leads to overly optimistic performance estimates. Using `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` is the standard and correct way to integrate preprocessing steps into your cross-validation workflow. It ensures that information from the validation set does not improperly influence the model training process via shared preprocessing parameters, giving you a much more reliable estimate of your model's true generalization ability. **Always use pipelines for preprocessing within CV.**"
